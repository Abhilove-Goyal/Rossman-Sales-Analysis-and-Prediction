# Rossman-Sales-Analysis-and-Prediction
This project analyzes Rossmann store sales data to predict future sales using various machine learning techniques. I applied linear models, decision trees, and random forest algorithms to capture patterns in sales influenced by factors like promotions, holidays, and store-specific conditions. The goal is to accurately forecast future sales trends.
